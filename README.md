# üê¶ Flappy Bird

A modern recreation of the classic arcade mobile game **Flappy Bird**, built using the **Unity** game engine. This project demonstrates core game development concepts in Unity, including C# scripting, physics, and UI management.

## üöÄ Features

- **Flap-to-Fly Mechanic**  
  The bird's movement is controlled by a single input (Space key), applying an upward force to a `Rigidbody2D`.

- **Procedural Pipe Generation**  
  Pipes are spawned at a regular `spawnRate` of **2 seconds** from a Pipe Spawner object. The vertical position of the gap is randomized between a `minY` of **-1f** and a `maxY` of **3f**.

- **Dynamic Obstacles**  
  Pipes move continuously from right to left at a fixed `moveSpeed` of **5 units per second**. Once a pipe moves past a certain `deadZone` of **-90**, it is automatically destroyed to optimize performance.

- **Scoring System**  
  The player's score is tracked by a `LogicScript`. A `PipeMiddleScript` on each pipe detects when the bird passes through the gap and increases the score by 1.

- **Game Over Screen**  
  A Game Over screen is set to inactive by default. When the bird collides with a pipe, the `gameOver()` function is triggered, activating this screen and ending the game.

- **Restart Functionality**  
  A "Play Again" button on the Game Over screen calls the `restartGame()` method in the `LogicScript`, reloading the active scene to start a new game.
