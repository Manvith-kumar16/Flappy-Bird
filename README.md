üê¶ Flappy Bird (Unity Project)
A modern recreation of the classic arcade mobile game, Flappy Bird, built using the Unity game engine. This project demonstrates core game development concepts in Unity, including C# scripting, physics, and UI management.


üöÄ Features

Flap-to-Fly Mechanic: The bird's movement is controlled by a single input (Space key), applying an upward force to a Rigidbody2D.


Procedural Pipe Generation: Pipes are spawned at a regular spawnRate of 2 seconds from a Pipe Spawner object. The vertical position of the gap is randomized between a 


minY of -1f and a maxY of 3f.


Dynamic Obstacles: Pipes move continuously from right to left at a fixed moveSpeed of 5 units per second. Once a pipe moves past a certain 

deadZone, it is automatically deleted from the scene.


Scoring System: The player's score is tracked by a LogicScript. A 

PipeMiddleScript on each pipe detects when the bird passes through the gap and increases the score by 1.


Game Over Screen: A Game Over Screen is set to inactive by default. When the bird collides with a pipe, the 

gameOver function is called, activating this screen and ending the game.


Restart Functionality: A "Play Again" button on the game over screen calls the restartGame() method in the LogicScript, which reloads the active scene to start a new game.



üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
Game Engine: Unity

Language: C#


Physics: Unity's built-in 2D physics engine (Rigidbody2D and CircleCollider2D) 

Rendering: Universal Render Pipeline (URP)
